# Rust for C#/.NET Developers

https://microsoft.github.io/rust-for-dotnet-devs/latest/getting-started/index.html

The execution environment of the Rust Playground has some limitations, such as total compilation/execution time, memory and networking so another option that does not require installing Rust would be to use a dev container, such as the one provided in the repository https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-rust. Like Rust Playground, the dev container can be run directly in a Web browser using GitHub Codespaces or locally using Visual Studio Code.
